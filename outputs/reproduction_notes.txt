To reproduce this, you can use any version of Switch that was active from
2020-06-04 12:52pm to 2020-06-10 19:39pm. 

Alternatively, you can use any version that was active from 2020-06-10 19:39pm 
to 2020-06-26 12:30pm (and maybe later), but change the federal tax credit for 
DistPV in 2020-2021 back to 0.3 (in switch_model.hawaii.fed_subsidies).

Both of these are with cplexamp 12.6.0.0 with 

--solver-options-string="iisfind=1 mipgap=0.005 mipemphasis=1 mipbasis=1 nodefile=3 memoryemphasis=1 display=1 mipdisplay=2 threads=1 parallelmode=-1 numericalemphasis=1 basis_cond=1 timing=4 mipalg=2 primalopt='' crash=1 time=216000 feasibility=1e-5"

The federal tax credit shouldn't affect the construction plan directly because
DistPV is fixed in this model. But it may create a slightly different solution 
path or it may affect the optimality gap (slightly higher cost due to the
erroneous credit, so cplex doesn't search quite as far to get the optimality 
gap down to 0.005).
